            <h2> Description</h2>
            <p>Island 51 is a computer game that you play from a top-down perspective, which means you’re looking down on the action from above. This style is common in 2D games and gives you a good view of the world around your character.</p>

            <p>The game is set on an island, and your character is a survivor who needs to stay alive. To do this, you’ll need to fight off enemies. These could be creatures that live on the island or maybe other survivors who are also trying to stay alive.</p>
            
            <p>But fighting isn’t the only thing you need to do in “Island 51”. The game also requires you to gather resources. This could involve things like collecting wood to build a shelter or finding food to keep your character healthy. The resources you gather can also be used to craft items that will help you survive.</p>
        
            <p>The ultimate goal in “Island 51” is to escape the island. To do this, you’ll need to build a boat. </p>
    
            <p> Island 51 was built using a programming language called C++ and a library called SFML. C++ is a popular language for game development because it’s very powerful and gives developers a lot of control. SFML stands for Simple and Fast Multimedia Library, and it provides functions that make it easier to develop games. For example, it can help with displaying graphics, playing sounds, and handling user input.</p>
